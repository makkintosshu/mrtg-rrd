===================================================================
RELEASE 0.4

* Wed Jan  9 13:50:29 CET 2002
	Fixed the incorrect behaviour when IconDir is not set. Now it displays
		the icons from the same directory where the script is located.
	Fixed the misplaced lc() in the config dir name (bug reported by
		Peter Banfi).
	Added few bug-hunting tips to the FAQ.
	Reformated the ChangeLog to the more readable/structured form.
	Implemented the double-column directory output. When the directory
		contains both subdirectories and graphs, the directory index
		consists of two sections - subdirs first and then graphs.
	The HTML files contain the RCS id of the script in comment in the
		banner part.
	Bumped the version number to 0.4

* Tue Jan  8 10:03:41 CET 2002
	Older versions of RRDtool do not grok the "-g" switch. Added testing
		the $RRDs::VERSION.

* Mon Jan  7 16:10:39 CET 2002
	Configuration file directives can have values including whitespace
		(thanks to Petr Prazak for discovering this).
	Added checking of the RRD::graph's error code (as suggested by
		Petr Prazak).


===================================================================
RELEASE 0.3

* Fri Jan  4 18:00:39 CET 2002
	Directory mode almost fully implemented.
	Bumped the version number to 0.3

* Wed Jan  2 17:57:31 CET 2002
	The Directory[] directive is now visible in the URL.

* Tue Dec 18 14:06:29 CET 2001
	Implemented the following mrtg.cfg directives:
		Unscaled, WithPeak, XZoom, YZoom
	Fixed the wrong behaviour of XScale, YScale.
	Added $version as the separate variable.
	Fixed the global options so that the graph still starts at y_min=0,
		even if there is no time when the variable is near 0.
	Fixed the [^], [_], and [$] behaviour for multiple configuration files
		(the value should not remain defined from the previous
		cfg. file).
