Implemented the following mrtg.cfg directives:
	Unscaled, WithPeak, XZoom, YZoom
Fixed the wrong behaviour of XScale, YScale.
Added $version as the separate variable.
Fixed the global options so that the graph still starts at y_min=0, even
	if there is no time when the variable is near 0.
Fixed the [^], [_], and [$] behaviour for multiple configuration files
	(the value should not remain defined from the previous cfg. file).
