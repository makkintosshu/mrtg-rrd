===================================================================
RELEASE 0.5

* Thu Feb 21 19:02:40 CET 2002
	Spelling fixes by Evans O'Shaughnessy.
	Multilple config files now works even with different WorkDirs etc.
	The parameters (such as IconDir or Refresh) for the directory
	is taken from the global configuration directives of the first target
	in the particular sub-tree.
	Bumped the version number to 0.5.

* Thu Feb  7 20:36:57 CET 2002
	Incorrect handling of Suppress[]: d (reported by Luc Ducazu).

		PNG file.

* Fri Jan 11 13:48:34 CET 2002
	Changed the non-portable strftime("%s", @t) to timelocal(@t)
		(the timelocal() is in the Time::Local module). This
		non-portability has been reported by Takuya Mori.


===================================================================
RELEASE 0.4

* Wed Jan  9 13:50:29 CET 2002
	Fixed the incorrect behaviour when IconDir is not set. Now it displays
		the icons from the same directory where the script is located.

		Peter Banfi).
	Added few bug-hunting tips to the FAQ.
	Reformated the ChangeLog to the more readable/structured form.
	Implemented the double-column directory output. When the directory
		contains both subdirectories and graphs, the directory index
		consists of two sections - subdirs first and then graphs.
	The HTML files contain the RCS id of the script in comment in the
		banner part.
	Bumped the version number to 0.4

* Tue Jan  8 10:03:41 CET 2002

	Configuration file directives can have values including whitespace
		(thanks to Petr Prazak for discovering this).

	Added $version as the separate variable.
	Fixed the global options so that the graph still starts at y_min=0,
		even if there is no time when the variable is near 0.
	Fixed the [^], [_], and [$] behaviour for multiple configuration files
		(the value should not remain defined from the previous
		cfg. file).
