Other TODO/missing items
========================

Option for setting the image format (PNG/GIF).

More customizable directory listing.

Exact time of the previous VRULE (for month and year graphs).

The MRTG-like legend on the X axis of the daily graph (every 2nd hour
	instead of every 6th our and ":00" appended).


Known bugs
==========

* It should complain if the RRD::graph() fails.
* Directory mode does not honour the "Suppress[]: d" and refers to the daily
	graph unconditionally.
* Directory mode does not generate the "WIDHT=" and "HEIGHT=" parameters
	to the <IMG> tag.
