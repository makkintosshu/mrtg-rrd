Unimplemented mrtg.cfg directives
=================================

Htmldir: (it is determined by the .cgi location); no static HTML is generated
NoMib2: (and displaying system uptime) I don't want to query routers from
	the CGI.
Language: TODO
Libadd: (handled separately) Don't want to mess with more BEGIN{} statements.
RouterUptime: I don't want to query the routers from the CGI.
Extension: (has no meaning)
YTics: don't know how to tell this to rrdgraph
YTicsFactor: don't know how to tell this to rrdgraph
Step: don't know what this should do
Option:
	growright: it is the default (don't know how to make growleft graphs)
	noi: TODO
	noo: TODO
SetEnv: Makes sense only for Target[]. Not implemented.
Weekformat: Dont know how to do this


Other TODO/missing items
========================

Option for setting the image format (PNG/GIF).

More customizable directory listing.

Exact time of the previous VRULE (for month and year graphs).

The MRTG-like legend on the X axis of the daily graph (every 2nd hour
	instead of every 6th our and ":00" appended).

Two-columned directory index? Suggested by Peter Banfi.

The CGI speedup methods other than FastCGI (speedycgi?).


Known bugs
==========

* Directory mode does not honour the "Suppress[]: d" and refers to the daily
	graph unconditionally.
* Directory mode does not generate the "WIDHT=" and "HEIGHT=" parameters
	to the <IMG> tag.
* kMG[]: <empty> is not implemented
